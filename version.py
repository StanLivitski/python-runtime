    Parameters
    ----------
    value : int
        A value to be tested.
    bounds : int | tuple(int, int)
        Low boundary of the range, or a tuple of the form (low, high+1).

    Checks the Python runtime version against constraints provided

    Checks the Python runtime version against constraints provided
    by the caller and raises an exception if the check fails. On
    success, returns nothing. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    major : int | tuple(int, int)
        Lowest major Python version supported by the caller, or
        a tuple of the form (lowest, highest+1).
    minor : int | tuple(int, int)
        Lowest minor Python version supported by the caller, or
        a tuple of the form (lowest, highest+1). If omitted, zero
        is assumed.
    legend : str
        A string describing the client to be included in error
        message.

    Raises
    ------
    Unsupported
        If the runtime version is not supported by the caller.
